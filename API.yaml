  description: "For now: people and organizations are all \"Customers\", with \"orgnr\"\
    \ as unique identifier.\n\nIn sales, commerce and economics, a customer (sometimes\
    \ known as a client, buyer, or purchaser) is the recipient of a good, service,\
    \ product or an idea - obtained from a seller, vendor, or supplier via a financial\
    \ transaction or exchange for money or some other valuable consideration. An ultimate\
    \ etymology of \"client\" may imply someone merely inclined to do business, whereas\
    \ a purchaser procures goods or services on occasion but a customer customarily\
    \ or habitually engages in transactions (historically: the collection of tolls\
    \ or taxes - see the Wiktionary etymology of customer). Such distinctions have\
    \ no contemporary semantic weight."
- name: "Accounts"
  description: "A transaction account, checking account, current account or demand\
    \ deposit account is a deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution.\
    \ It is available to the account owner \"on demand\" and is available for frequent\
    \ and immediate access by the account owner or to others as the account owner\
    \ may direct. Access may be in a variety of ways, such as cash withdrawals, use\
    \ of cheques and debit by electronic transfer. In economic terms, the funds held\
    \ in a transaction account are regarded as liquid funds and in accounting terms\
    \ they are considered as cash."
- name: "Transactions"
  description: "A financial transaction is an agreement, communication, or movement\
    \ carried out between a buyer and a seller to exchange an asset for payment. It\
    \ involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or\
    \ individuals. The buyer and seller are separate entities or objects, often involving\
    \ the exchange of items of value, such as information, goods, services, and money.\
    \ It is still a transaction if the goods are exchanged at one time, and the money\
    \ at another. This is known as a two-part transaction: part one is giving the\
    \ money, part two is receiving the goods."
